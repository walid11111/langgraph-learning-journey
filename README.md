# 🚀 LangGraph Workflows & Agents

This repository contains my hands-on practice and implementations while learning **LangGraph** for workflow orchestration and agentic systems.

## 📌 Topics Covered
- Simple LLM Workflows
- Prompt Chaining
- Conditional Workflows
- Parallel Workflows
- Iterative Pipelines
- Persistence & State Management
- Subgraph Mechanisms
- Agentic Tools (LangGraph + LangChain)

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- Python
- LangGraph
- LangChain
- groq / HuggingFace APIs
- Vector Databases (ChromaDB)

## 🎯 Goal
To build a strong foundation in **workflow orchestration** and **agentic systems** using LangGraph, complementing my LangChain and LangSmith learning journey.
